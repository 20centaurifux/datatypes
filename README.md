# datatypes - README

This library provides some generic and abstract datatypes you might miss
in C. The following datatypes are available:

* hashtable (with fixed bucket size)
* red black tree
* singly-linked list
* doubly-linked list
* queue
* stack
* byte-buffer
* asynchronous (message) queue (requires POSIX threads!)
