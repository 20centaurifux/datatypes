# datatypes v0.1 - README

## Introduction

This library provides some generic and abstract datatypes you might miss
in C. The following datatypes are available:

* hashtable (with fixed bucket size)
* red-black tree
* singly-linked list
* doubly-linked list
* queue
* stack
* byte-buffer
* asynchronous (message) queue (requires POSIX threads!)

## Building

To build the library *GNU Make* is required. Please edit the Makefile to
change file locations and dependencies.

## Documentation

To generate the code documentation please run Doxygen[^1].
